What to Exclude Explicitly (reduces noise)

Strongly consider excluding:

Piston aircraft (C172, PA-28, etc.)

Airline aircraft (A320, B737, etc.)

Military-only types (unless you explicitly want them later)

Owner type = INDIVIDUAL (initially)

One subtle but important note

Some police and EMS helicopters are registered under holding companies or aviation contractors with generic names. That’s why model filtering must come first.

Behavior will do the rest.

** NOTE **
Model strings are inconsistent, filter should normalize to uppercase, match prefixes instead of full strings, and strip punctuation
